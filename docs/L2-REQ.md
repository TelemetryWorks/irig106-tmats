# irig106-tmats — Level 2 Requirements

> **Status: not yet written.** L2 requirements are derived from
> `docs/L1-REQ.md` once the L1 set and the architecture (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)
> have been reviewed.

## Purpose

This document establishes the Level 2 (L2) SHALL-statement requirements. L2
requirements are architectural derivations of the L1 requirements in
`L1-REQ.md`: they specify *how* each L1 obligation is structurally satisfied,
without yet prescribing implementation details (those belong to L3).

## Conventions

L2 identifiers follow the format `L2-<CATEGORY>-<NNN>`. Each L2 is a level-4
heading (`#### L2-XXX-NNN`) and declares exactly one parent on a line of the
form `**Parent**: L1-XXX-NNN`; when an L2 is motivated by several L1s, the
primary one is the parent and the others are named in the rationale. Metadata
fields (Statement, Rationale, Verification Method, and Evidence where the
method is not Test) carry the same meaning as in `L1-REQ.md`. Numbering is
monotone within each category; retired identifiers are never reused.

**Status and verification artifacts** are tracked in
[`docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md`](TRACE-MATRIX.md), regenerated from test markers and
parent links by `scripts/build-trace-matrix.py`. This file holds only spec
content.
