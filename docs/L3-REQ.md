# irig106-tmats — Level 3 Requirements

> **Status: not yet written.** L3 requirements follow the L2 set.

## Purpose

This document establishes the Level 3 (L3) SHALL-statement requirements. L3
requirements decompose each L2 into **implementation-level obligations**:
specific type and function names, exact values and thresholds, and behaviour
under edge conditions. L3s are the level at which requirements become
directly testable against code.

## Conventions

L3 identifiers follow the format `L3-<CATEGORY>-<NNN>` and use a compact
two-line format:

> **L3-XXX-NNN** · Parent: L2-XXX-NNN · Verification: T
> *Statement.*

A requirement verified other than by Test adds a trailing
`· Evidence: <artifact>` segment on the same line. Verification method
abbreviations: **T** = Test, **A** = Analysis, **I** = Inspection,
**D** = Demonstration. L3 categories mirror the L2 category they refine;
`LIB` and `CLI` are reserved for obligations that apply only to the library
crate or only to the `tmats` crate.

L3 entries are added only where there is genuine implementation detail that
cannot be inferred from the L2 statement.

**Status and verification artifacts** are tracked in
[`docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md`](TRACE-MATRIX.md). This file holds only spec content.
